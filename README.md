# CS480

Shared repo for tasks, meeting notes, and deliverables.

## How we work
- Create an **Issue** for every task and add it to the **CS480 Tasks** board.
- Branch naming: `feature/<short-name>` or `docs/<note-topic>`.
- Open a **PR** to `main` for any change; 1 review required.
- We meet every Sunday at 3pm for an ~1 hour. 

## Folders
- `docs/` – agendas, meeting notes, decisions.
- `tasks/` – checklists or larger multi-step task docs.
- `deliverables/` – final writeups/slides/code snippets.
- `templates/` – issue/PR templates (auto-used).
